# babylon-wallet-android
An Android wallet for interacting with the Radix DLT ledger.

## App requirements
- [Android 8.1](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/oreo/android-8.1) minimum Android version
- Support of handsets and no tablets.

## Architecture and tech stack
The architecture is based on the [Android app architecture](https://developer.android.com/topic/architecture) which follows some concepts of the [Clean Architecture](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html).
So first, please read this one! :) 
In short for architecture:
- Data and presentation layers are the must layers of the app.
- Each of this layer contains its own data models and then we map from one to the other.
- The mapping take place inside the data model (e.g. `AccountDto`). 
- In general we add logic to the data model (e.g. `TokenUi`) only if it is relevant to the data.
- The data layer mostly uses the [repository pattern](https://developer.android.com/static/codelabs/basic-android-kotlin-training-repository-pattern/img/69021c8142d29198.png).
- Domain layer is used to hold the repository interfaces. And later those interfaces will be used for use cases if a use case is needed.
- Domain layer can have its own data models if it is needed. (e.g. to manipulate the data from the data layer, or to combine two or more different data models from the data layer to one in the domain layer.)
- Use cases can provide real benefits in some scenarios, please see 4 bullets [here](https://developer.android.com/topic/architecture/domain-layer). Another example of a use case is the `ShowOnboardingUseCase`.
- MVVM for the presentation layer

The tech stack:
- [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose) for UI
- [Material 3](https://m3.material.io/) it is actually enabled but not correctly/heavily used. (Dark mode support will be provided and implemented as we develop features.)
- [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) + [okhttp](https://square.github.io/okhttp/) for REST
- [Ktor](https://ktor.io/) for websockets
- [Hilt](https://developer.android.com/training/dependency-injection/hilt-android) for DI
- [Coil](https://coil-kt.github.io/coil/) for image loading
- [Detekt](https://detekt.dev/) + plugins (formatting, [compose rules](https://twitter.github.io/compose-rules/)) for static code analysis
- [JaCoCo](https://www.eclemma.org/jacoco/) for code coverage

We try to stay with native libraries as much as possible. As less third party dependencies as possible.

## Testing strategy (Pyramid of UI, Linear Image regression, Unit from top to bottom, etc.)

For the beginning, we developers require to have unit tests as the development process. This will be the only part of the testing pyramid for now. At the later point, UI tests are likely to be introduced. TBC.

## Useful tips/resources and best practices (IMPORTANT)
- [Keep It Simple](https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6141f431cb79cea26593300b/Shortcut-From-Point-A-to-Point-B-Concept/960x0.jpg?format=jpg&width=960)

## CI/CD and Git
- [Git branching strategy](https://radixdlt.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/AT/pages/2826076188/Git+branching+strategy)
- How to create [GitHub repository](https://radixdlt.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/EN/pages/2804023327/Github+repositories)
- At the moment we use GitHub Actions + [fastlane](https://fastlane.tools/)

## Security rules
- For the security reason we prefer not to store confidential data (tokens, user password, confidential data fetched from backend) on the phone. If we really need to, they should be encrypted up to the best known standards. 
- SSL pinning (Certificate or Public Key pinning) would be preferred to secure http data transfer. 
- Strict code reviews, ideally followed by manual smoke test 
- No change should be committed without ticket associated with it
